Project Title: Pest Identification and Management System Using CNN and Google API

Description: This project focuses on developing a frontend interface for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to identify and manage pests from The Dangerous Farm Insects Image Dataset, featuring 15 insect types. The system aims to assist in pest identification, crop protection, and yield enhancement. Using the Google API, the application ensures seamless integration for image processing, real-time insights, and data visualization, making it a powerful tool for farmers and agricultural experts to mitigate crop damage caused by pests efficiently.

Key Features: Image-Based Pest Identification: Leverages CNN for accurate classification of pests. Dataset: Utilizes a curated dataset of 15 types of dangerous farm insects for training and evaluation. Crop Protection: Provides actionable recommendations for pest management. Google API Integration: Enhances usability by enabling image uploads, cloud-based analysis, and visualization tools. User-Friendly Interface: Designed for farmers and agricultural professionals with easy navigation and clear outputs. Outcome: The project aims to reduce crop losses, improve agricultural productivity, and assist in sustainable pest management practices using AI-drivenÂ technology.
